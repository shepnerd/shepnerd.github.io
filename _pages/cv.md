Biography
======
I am currently a Research Scientist at Shanghai AI Laboratory, working on video understanding. I am working closely with Prof. Yu Qiao, Prof. Limin Wang, and Dr. Yali Wang. I did my Ph.D. at CSE of The Chinese University of Hong Kong, supervised by Prof. [Jiaya Jia](https://jiaya.me/) and Prof. [Liwei Wang](https://lwwangcse.github.io/).  My research interests include computer vision and deep learning, especially image generation and related applications. Before that, I got the M.Sc. degree from Peking University (supervised by Prof. Yuexian Zou).
